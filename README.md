# SeraphinaFetch
Just a silly little fastfetch .jsonc config file I spent a few hours working on, it took that long because this was my first time writing a config for anything :D.

I reccommend using a proper png logo, because I had issues getting the normal logos the right size.

The templates I used to make writing it a little easier are also included!
