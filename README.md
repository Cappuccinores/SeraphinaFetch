# SeraphinaFetch
Just a silly little fastfetch .jsonc config file I spent a few hours working on, it took that long because this was my first time writing a config for anything :D.

I reccommend using a proper png logo, because I had issues getting the normal logos the right size.

The templates I used to make writing it a little easier are also included!

Full Version (/config/config.jsonc)
<img width="965" height="928" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bad06673-5a89-4507-9aab-36f9b87adaa5" />

Slightly Smaller Version (/config/config-small.jsonc
<img width="964" height="799" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/438796bc-931f-4b5d-b5e0-ac08297cebd8" />


This is the basic template that started it all:
