# SeraphinaFetch
Just a silly little fastfetch .jsonc config file I spent a few hours working on, it took that long because this was my first time writing a config for anything :D.

I reccommend using a proper png logo, because I had issues getting the normal logos the right size.

The templates I used to make writing it a little easier are also included!

All the symbols and such were obtained from these sites


This is the basic template that started it all

Special Thanks to Zoxe from the CachyOS discord for providing all of the tools for me to get started, it's all thanks to them :D.
