# SeraphinaFetch
Just a silly little fastfetch .jsonc config file I spent a few hours working on, it took that long because this was my first time writing a config for anything :D.

Make sure to put the extracted folder in your /home directory, cause it contains a bunch of logo files I was messing with in the course of writing this... or don't if you know how to change the logo D: .

The templates I used to make writing it a little easier are also included!
